# SMS Spam Classification

This repository contains code for developing a text classification model to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham) using data science techniques in Python.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam. We'll use various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to preprocess the text data, extract features, and train a classification model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project typically consists of a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or non-spam. You can find datasets for SMS spam classification on platforms like Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Directory Structure

- **data/**: This directory contains the dataset Zip file `spam.csv`.
- **notebooks/**: This directory contains the Jupyter Notebook `SMS-Classifier.ipynb`, where the model development and evaluation are performed.
- **README.md**: This README file providing instructions and information about the project.
- **requirements.txt**: This file contains a list of Python dependencies required to run the code.

## Usage Instructions

To replicate this project:
1. **Install Dependencies**:
- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Navigate to the repository directory:
  ```
  cd SMS-Spam-Classification
  ```
- Install necessary Python libraries using pip:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
